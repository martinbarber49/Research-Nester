<p>Research Nester&rsquo;s recent market research analysis on <strong>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.researchnester.com/reports/aliphatic-solvent-market/3328">Aliphatic Solvent Market</a>: Global Demand Analysis &amp; Opportunity Outlook 2036&rdquo; </strong>delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global aliphatic solvent market in terms of market segmentation by type, application, and by region.</p>
<p><strong><em>Growing Construction and Automotive Industry to Promote </em></strong><strong><em>Global Market Share of </em></strong><strong><em>Aliphatic Solvent</em></strong></p>
<p>The growing need for paints and coatings due to the increasing number of residential and commercial buildings brought about by population growth and urbanization is anticipated to drive the global market for aliphatic solvents to rapid expansion during the forecast period. Furthermore, it is anticipated that in the years to come, the development of novel and inventive aliphatic solvents will be fueled by the increased emphasis on sustainability and the growing need for ecologically friendly solvents. The aliphatic solvents market is expected to see new growth prospects with the development of bio-based aliphatic solvents.</p>
<p>Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global aliphatic solvent market are:</p>
<p><strong><em>Growth Drivers:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Surge in Rubber Sector Will Increase Need for Aliphatic Solvents</li>
<li>Rising Turpentine Substitution with Mineral Spirits</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Challenges:</em></strong></p>
<p>Workers who handle solvents in the course of producing aliphatic solvents and thinners frequently come into contact with them, which can be harmful to their neurological and respiratory systems. Producers of aliphatic solvents and thinners are now considering the use of organic solvents as an alternative due to the stringent restrictions controlling the use of solvents. Negative consequences and a transition to greener substitutes and high cost are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of aliphatic solvent.</p>

<p>By application, the global aliphatic solvent market is segmented into paints &amp; coatings, adhesives, rubbers &amp; polymers, oil &amp; gas, aerosol and cleaning &amp; degreasing. The paints &amp; coatings segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Aliphatic solvents are widely used as diluents and solvents for resins, binders, and pigments in the paint and coatings industry. The need for aliphatic solvents in the paint and coatings business is being driven by the growth of the construction industry, the requirement for high-performance coatings, and the trend toward low-VOC coatings. Two more important applications for aliphatic solvents are cleaning and degreasing, particularly in the industrial and automotive sectors. The growing building and construction sector are increasing the requirement for aliphatic solvents as thinners and diluents in paints and coatings. In addition to adhesives, paints, and coatings especially made for the building sector, processors employ these solvents as degreasing and cleaning agents.</p>
<p>By region, the Europe aliphatic solvent market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. The market for traditional hydrocarbon solvents is shifting, especially in North America and Europe where strict environmental laws and regulations have made it possible to use bio-green hydrocarbon solvents. Aromatic solvents are predicted to gradually diminish whereas aliphatic solvents, which now have a significant market share, are predicted to climb steadily. The greatest market for hydrocarbon solvent applications is in painting and coatings, with printing ink, adhesives, and pharmaceuticals following suit.</p>
<p>This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global aliphatic solvent market which includes company profiling of ExxonMobil Corporation, Reliance Industries Limited, Marathon Petroleum Corporation, E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company, PJSC Lukoil Oil Company, Valero Energy Corporation, Shell Plc, Honeywell International Inc., Janex S.A, and others.</p>
